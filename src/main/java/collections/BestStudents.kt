// Implement makeBestStudentsList method to display the best 10 students,
// so they can get an internship. You should compare them by their result
// (higher is better). To get an internship, students need to have got
// at least 30 points in the semester and a result of at least 80.
// The best student gets $5000, the next 3 get $3000 and the next 6 get $1000.
// Display students in alphabetical order (compare first surname then name)
// in the format “{name} {surname}, ${internship size}”
